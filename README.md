# Birdeye

This is a top-down game engine with Lua support and a built-in level loader, written using SFML for rendering, and Luabridge to provide a Lua interface with the engine internals. All of the weapons and levels are implemented as Lua scripts and external files, so you can create your own and have some fun with it.

## Why?

This was an educational project, written on and off over the course of a couple of months. Although the code is a bit of a mess, I had a lot of fun and learned a lot!
