# top-down-shooter

This is a top-down shooter engine with Lua support and a built-in level loader, written using SFML for rendering, and Luabridge to provide a Lua interface with the engine internals. All of the weapons and levels are implemented as Lua scripts and external files, although the API is quite restrictive.

## Why?

This was an educational project (and the code is largely unfinished), written on and off over the course of a couple of months. Although the code is a bit of a mess, I had a lot of fun and learned a lot!
